This is a very simple proof-of-concept service to implement an Account API that relies on an external authentication service.

It providers the following services:

1. An API for checking to see if a session has been established;
2. An API for destroying a session;
3. A redirect link for transfering control to an external identity provider/authentication service;
4. A callback that an external identity provider/authentication service can use to establish a new session.

Once a session has been established, access to other API methods is secured by the session.

Identity Providers

Any SAML 2.0 Identity Provider can be configured to provide federated authentication.

The quickest and easiest way to integrate a new IdP is to point the application at their metadata file (app.rb:19-20).

Notes on various identity providers:

OneLogin - very simple to set up on your own. This set up does not use SAML metadata, it's currently the master branch, just configure the individual SAML settings.
ID.me - you'll need to have ID.me set you up as a relying party, and will need to generate a self-signed certificate to send them. Use the ID.me branch.
